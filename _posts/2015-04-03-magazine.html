  Brief: Magazine ad entitled 'We Make It Easy', SingleHop and Avant
</p>

<p>
  Product: Clean lines and 'enterprise-feel', dark background and shadows to add to mystery -- part of the SingleHop brand at the time. The goal was to get a message across quickly and spark interest in tech-saavy sales people. The maze can actually be done, which is a nice bonus if you're bored on the subway.
